# Facebook-lite-OAuth-Passport
<p>I have used to Google developers, Google cloud platform and API console to implement passport.js in creating a Google authentication on my login signup
page in the project.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
I wanted my project to help the user in signing up directly through their FacebookID, so that it'll save their time. I used passport.js in this process, 
going on their official website i learnt the procedure of the requiring passport.js, we have other applications too for signing up like google,
Twitter, github etc, I used Google.
<br></br>
I made three folders, config with a folder model with file user_model in which I have created the Schema for mongodb to pass the data to my collection 
of the database and then we have two file named as keys and passport-setup, where keys is used to specify the client id and client secret and passport-setup 
is the whole setup I made for Google authentication of my user through google, these commands lines can be found on passportjs.org the official website of
passport.js. Then we have routers, where we have four files auth-routes, profile-routes and login, signup. Auth-routes is made for giving the routing to the user 
authentication and profile-routes is for giving routing to the profile of the user, the two files signup and login are made to signup the user if he is new to 
the page and puting his data in the database as the normal procedure of taking name, email and password. We have used to ejs templating engine in our views 
folder where we have a file home for home page UI, a file login for the login page UI, and last is the profile page UI, we have made three of them through 
HTML and CSS and connected the files links of user authentication and login through buttons. 
<br></br>
Finally! we have a file app.js which is the base of the project used for connecting and requiring every file for rendering and routing, connecting 
database and at last but not the least giving the port through, storing the port in a env file and requiring it on top.
