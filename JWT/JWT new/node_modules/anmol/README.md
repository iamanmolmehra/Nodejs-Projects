# NPX CARD
This my NPX card unique style to connect with me directly via console or terminal

üëá just hit 
```bash
npx anmol
```
And get to know me in unique style.

### I spent a non-trivial amount of effort building and designing this iteration of npx card, and I am proud of it! All I ask of you all is to put a **star** ‚≠ê on this project and not claim this effort as your own ‚ô•.

### SCREENSHOT

The final output might look something like this:

##### STEPS TO CREATE YOUR OWN

#### npm init

Start a new `node` project and name it whatever you want. You could choose to name it after the executable you want to expose. It‚Äôs not necessary but conventions are nice, and it makes your binary more `npx` friendly.

```bash
mkdir anmol
cd anmol
npm init -y
```
At first, let‚Äôs get the necessary CLI working.

```bash
touch card.js
chmod +x card.js
```
Now open the new file in your favorite editor. I‚Äôve been using `Intellij WebStorm`.

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node

console.log('doing business')
```
Be creative and add logic to create your own card in `card.js` file.
or you can simply copy my `card.js` file and make necessary changes as required

#### ship it

That‚Äôs an entirely functional first release! You just need to modify your `package.json` to let `npm` know to link your executable and you are off:

```json
{
  // ...
  "bin": "./card.js",
  // ....
}
```
By default, `npm` will expose your binary using the same name as your package

Share your new CLI with the world!

```bash
npm version patch
npm publish
```

Now anyone can leverage your new CLI using `npx`, without needing to install it locally:

```bash
npx $YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME
```

Now you have a globally executable script, that can leverage all of `npm`, to perform awesome utilities (or silly ideas like this). If you find you are writing a ‚Äòbig‚Äô CLI with lots of parameters or sub-commands, you will want more options around how to define your CLI and should consider trying [yargs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yargs) instead of [minimist](https://www.npmjs.com/package/minimist).
